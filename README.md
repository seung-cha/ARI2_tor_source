# ARI applications
repo of my source code for ARI robot, as a Taste of Research program from UNSW. ROS messages are required and not included in this repo.  
To run the code, find and add the following messages:
* hri_msgs
* hri_actions_msgs
* humanoid_msgs
* pal_msgs  


Additionally, supply a llama model in llama_chatbot/models/ to run llama_chatbot.  
  
  UML to be supported.
